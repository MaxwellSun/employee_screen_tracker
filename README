Employee Screen Tracker (Remote Screencapture)

This C++ application runs quietly on any Windows machine and sends screenshots at regular intervals to your web server.

It can be used for tracking employees' work time, providing simple support to clients, or just tracking what's going on on a computer throughout the day.

The image filenames are based on the application's filename, which are validated using a custom validator service on your web server.
